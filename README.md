# Change Prefix or Suffix of Files in a Folder

This is a simple program with four functionalities:
1. Add prefix to every filename in a directory
1. Add suffix to every filename in a directory
1. Remove prefix from every filename in a directory (if it contains that prefix)
1. Remove suffix from every filename in a directory (if it contains that suffix)

## Input
1. `path`: Path of the desired directory
1. `prefix_to_add`: The prefix to be added
1. `prefix_to_rmv`: The prefix to be removed
1. `suffix_to_add`: The suffix to be added
1. `suffix_to_rmv`: The suffix to be removed

## Heads Up!
This blind program has no feeling about leading or trailing whitespaces. Whenever you are concerned about a whitespace, you have to explicitly write it down as input.
